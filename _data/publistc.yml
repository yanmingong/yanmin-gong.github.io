  description: Recent studies show that graph-based machine learning models are especially vulnerable to adversarial perturbations due to the non i.i.d nature of graph data. By adding or deleting a small number of edges in the graph, adversaries could greatly change the graph label predicted by a graph classification model. In this work, we propose to build a smoothed graph classification model with certified robustness guarantee.

  description: Social recommendations rely on oneâ€™s social connections to make personalized recommendations. However, an adversarial party could compromise the recommendations by exploiting users' social connections. We propose targeted poisoning attacks against social recommender systems by injecting fake ratings and social connections.
