### Research Lab Info
The Trustworthy and Intelligent Networked Systems (TINS) Lab at University of Texas at San Antonio, led by Dr. Yanmin Gong, is focused on in-depth understanding and fundamental design in security and privacy, machine learning, Internet of things, and wireless networks. Our research is motivated by the urgent need for secure, privacy-preserving, and intelligent solutions to allowing people to learn information as it was intended for and stopping people from learning information in ways it was not intended for in the big data and AI era.
